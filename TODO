- more examples (with some api call stuff, e.g. to search engines, etc.)
    - no system prompt example, entirely do through functions,
        (or the system prompt says that),
        then start with an instruction_function(),
        which must be called at the start.
        - could do that as the default :O :D.
            then default to empty messages initially :O,
            leaving the option of passing a system prompt as normal.

    - SQL example, chat
    - Autonomous example
    - getting name first, then getting phone number (or something)
    - scraping wikipedia/duckduckgo, then doing something else (idk)

- more unit test coverage
- squash / rebase branch before merging into main, then archive
- functions with no args
- tutorials
