- more examples (with some api call stuff, e.g. to search engines, etc.)
    - no system prompt example, entirely do through functions,
        (or the system prompt says that),
        then start with an instruction_function(),
        which must be called at the start.
        - could do that as the default :O :D.
            then default to empty messages initially :O,
            leaving the option of passing a system prompt as normal.
    - RAG example, chat
    - SQL example, chat
    - Autonomous example
    - getting name first, then getting phone number (or something)
    - scraping wikipedia/duckduckgo, then doing something else (idk)
    - writing code, and searching stackoverflow if stuck
- gifs for the examples (record in console)
- more unit test coverage


- tutorial notebook
    - document ways to stop / wait for confirmation before running functions (e.g. when powerful)
- set docs dir in github to `docs`

Low priority:
- ability to check number of tokens with tiktoken
- summariser / reducer (e.g. run before making llm call)
- Check for license in scripts
- Put tutorial notebook/s into jekyll

- [x] doc generation using sphinx
- [x] ability to configure completion, e.g. model etc.
- [x] funcs with no args
- [x] license in scripts
- [x] squash / rebase branch before merging into main, then archive
