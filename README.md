# MakeAgents 

MakeAgents is a micro framework for creating LLM-driven agents.

The MakeAgents paradigm is to define an agent's behaviour and capabilities entirely through **action functions**, and an **action graph**.

Currently supports OpenAI's GPT chat models out of the box.

## Setup

- Install `make_agents` using your package manager, e.g. `pip install make_agents`
- Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable, with your [OpenAI api key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key).
    - Alternatively, `import openai` and set `openai.api_key = ...`
- See the examples below, and the reference docs.

## Examples

### Example 1: A conversational agent tasked with getting the user's name


```python
import json
from IPython.display import display, Markdown
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
import make_agents as ma
```

#### Action function, `message_user`

An action function must have at most one argument, and that argument must be annotated with a Pydantic model. 
The function's name, its docstring, and the Pydantic model, is provided to the LLM, and should be considered as part of the promping strategy.
It's not recommended to annotate the arg in the docstring, since it is done via the Pydantic model already.

This action function allows the agent to message the user, and get a response.


```python
class MessageUserArg(BaseModel):
    message: str = Field(description="Message to send user")


@ma.action
def message_user(arg: MessageUserArg):
    """Send the user a message, and get their response."""
    response = ""
    while response == "":
        response = input(arg.message).strip()
    return response
```


```python
# Define the remaining action functions.


@ma.action
def get_task_instructions():
    return "Your task is to get both the user's first and last name."


class LogNameArg(BaseModel):
    first_name: str = Field(description="User's first name")
    last_name: str = Field(description="User's last name")


@ma.action
def record_first_and_last_name(arg: LogNameArg):
    """Record the users first and last name."""
    return {"first_name": arg.first_name, "last_name": arg.last_name}


# Then define action graph
action_graph = {
    ma.Start: [get_task_instructions],
    get_task_instructions: [message_user],
    message_user: [message_user, record_first_and_last_name],
}
display(Markdown("### Action graph"))
display(ma.bonus.draw_graph(action_graph))

# Finally, run the agent
display(Markdown("### Agent execution log"))
for messages in ma.run_agent(action_graph):
    ma.bonus.pretty_print(messages[-1])  # print most recent message on stack
print(f"Retrieved user_name: {json.loads(messages[-1]['content'])}")
```

    call `get_task_instructions`: <no arguments>

    Retrieved user_name: {'first_name': 'Bill', 'last_name': 'BoBaggins'}


### Example 2: A system assistant <span style="color:red"> — _dangerous_</span>

In this example, the agent is allowed to run bash commands on your system, and read the results... Validation is implemented, so please make sure you understand the command before allowing it to run.


```python
import subprocess
import shlex
```


```python
@ma.action
def get_task_instructions():
    return "Your task is help the user with their computer system, until they ask to end the chat. Please give the user only the relevant information."


class RunBashCommandArg(BaseModel):
    plan: str = Field(description="Plan what to run")
    command: str = Field(description="Command to run")


@ma.action
def run_bash_command(arg: RunBashCommandArg):
    """Record the users first and last name."""
    result = subprocess.run(shlex.split(arg.command), capture_output=True, text=True)
    return {"stout": result.stdout, "stderr": result.stderr}


# Define action graph
action_graph = {
    ma.Start: [get_task_instructions],
    get_task_instructions: [message_user],
    message_user: [message_user, run_bash_command, ma.End],
    run_bash_command: [message_user, run_bash_command],
}
display(Markdown("### Action graph"))
display(ma.bonus.draw_graph(action_graph))

# Run the agent
display(Markdown("### Agent execution log"))
for messages in ma.run_agent(action_graph):
    ma.bonus.pretty_print(messages[-1])
    if messages[-1].get("function_call", {}).get("name", "") == run_bash_command.__name__:
        command = json.loads(messages[-1]["function_call"]["arguments"])["command"]
        input(
            f"Please validate the bash command, before pressing enter to continue. Command: `{command}`"
        )

### Notes:

- Prompting has a big impact on the performance of the agent. Action function names, Pydantic models and docstrings can all be considered part of the prompting strategy.
- The current preferred way to deal with exceptions due to the model not providing correct function args is to modify the prompts / action graph, to reduce the error rate.
- "gpt-4" is used by default, and performs better than "gpt-3.5-turbo", (at least with the current set up and prompts).


### Contributing

- For any ideas/comments/suggestions, create a GitHub issue, or comment in a relevant issue.
- For the development of the framework itself, the aspiration is take an "example driven" development approach. 
    I.e. find compelling examples where a feature / change would be helpful before adding it.
- Consider sharing anything cool you've made!

### Dev setup

- Clone the repo and `cd` into it
- Run `poetry install`
- Run `poetry run pre-commit install`
